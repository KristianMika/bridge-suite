# Usage

## Configuration

Currently, the extension doesn't provide any configuration means. All changes have to be made directly to the source coude.

In the future, the bridge can be configured using [Bridge Controller](../bridge-controller/index.md) or via its GUI.

### Current Configuration

- **group selection policy**: The first FROST authentication group containing a "nostr" substring in its name.
- **Meesign Server instance**: localhost:1337
- **Envoy proxy**: localhost:8080

## Use Cases

- [Nostr event signing](../../use cases/nostr.md)
