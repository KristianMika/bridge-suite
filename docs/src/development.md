# Development

## Devcontainer

The **devcontainer** folders located in project repositories contain a configuration of a development Docker environment for the particular projects.

1. Install the `ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers` VS Code extension.
2. Press ++ctrl+shift+p++, select`>Dev Containers: Open folder in Container...`, and select the root repository directory. (_this may take some time for the the first run_)
