# Cryptoki Bridge

Cryptoki Bridge is an implementation of the [PKCS#11](https://docs.oasis-open.org/pkcs11/pkcs11-base/v3.0/csprd01/pkcs11-base-v3.0-csprd01.html) standard. It's a shared library that can be loaded into any application that supports PKCS#11. The cryptographic operations are then delegated to [MeeSign](https://meesign.crocs.fi.muni.cz/) threshold platform.
